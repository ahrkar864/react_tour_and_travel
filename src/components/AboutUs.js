            <h1>Our History</h1>
            <p>
                Founded in 2015, Trippy emerged from a desire to transform the travel industry by introducing a new wave of exploratory experiences. Our founders, a group of avant-garde travel enthusiasts, noticed a gap in the market for genuinely unique and immersive travel experiences. Fueled by a passion for adventure and the unconventional, they embarked on a journey to create a travel company unlike any other.

                Trippy started with just three signature tours that promised more than just sightseeingâ€”they offered an exploration of the mind and spirit. Each tour was crafted to challenge perceptions, embrace the unusual, and uncover the beauty in the world's most enigmatic destinations. From the neon-lit streets of Tokyo's underground culture to the mystical deserts of Morocco, our tours quickly gained popularity among travelers seeking paths less trodden.
